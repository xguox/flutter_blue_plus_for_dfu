## Introduction

FlutterBluePlus is a Bluetooth Low Energy plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 

It supports BLE Central Role only (most common). 

If you need BLE Peripheral Role, you should check out [FlutterBlePeripheral](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ble_peripheral).

## ‚ùó Bluetooth Classic is not supported ‚ùó

 i.e. speakers, headphones, mice, keyboards, gamepads, Arduino HC-05 & HC-06, and more are not supported. These all use Bluetooth Classic.

 Also, iBeacons are **_not_** supported on iOS. Apple requires you to use CoreLocation.

## Cross-Platform Bluetooth Low Energy

FlutterBluePlus aims to offer the most from all supported platforms: iOS, macOS, Android.

The code is written to be simple, robust, and incredibly easy to understand.

## No Dependencies

FlutterBluePlus has zero dependencies besides Flutter, Android, and iOS themselves.

This makes FlutterBluePlus very stable, and easy to maintain.

## ‚≠ê Stars ‚≠ê

Please star this repo & on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue_plus). We all benefit from having a larger community.

## Example

FlutterBluePlus has a beautiful example app, useful to debug issues.

```
cd ./example
flutter run
```

## Usage

### :fire: Error Handling :fire:

Flutter Blue Plus takes error handling very seriously. 

Every error returned by the native platform is checked and thrown as an exception where appropriate. See [Reference](#reference) for a list of throwable functions.

**Streams:** At the time of writing, streams returned by Flutter Blue Plus never emit any errors and never close. There's no need to handle `onError` or `onDone` for  `stream.listen(...)`. The one exception is `FlutterBluePlus.scanResults`, which you should handle `onError`.

---

### Set Log Level

```dart
// if your terminal doesn't support color you'll see annoying logs like `\x1B[1;35m`
FlutterBluePlus.setLogLevel(LogLevel.verbose, color:false)
```

Setting `LogLevel.verbose` shows *all* data in and out.

‚ö´ = function name

üü£ = args to platform

üü° = data from platform

### Enable Bluetooth

**Note:** On iOS, a "*This app would like to use Bluetooth*" system dialogue appears on first call to any FlutterBluePlus method. 
 
```dart
// check adapter availability
// Note: The platform is initialized on the first call to any FlutterBluePlus method.
if (await FlutterBluePlus.isAvailable == false) {
    print("Bluetooth not supported by this device");
    return;
}

// handle bluetooth on & off
// note: for iOS the initial state is typically BluetoothAdapterState.unknown
// note: if you have permissions issues you will get stuck at BluetoothAdapterState.unauthorized
FlutterBluePlus.adapterState.listen((BluetoothAdapterState state) {
    print(state);
    if (state == BluetoothAdapterState.on) {
        // usually start scanning, connecting, etc
    } else {
        // show an error to the user, etc
    }
});

// turn on bluetooth ourself if we can
// for iOS, the user controls bluetooth enable/disable
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    await FlutterBluePlus.turnOn();
}
```

### Scan for devices

If your device is not found, see [Common Problems](#common-problems).

```dart
// Setup Listener for scan results.
// device not found? see "Common Problems" in the README
Set<DeviceIdentifier> seen = {};
var subscription = FlutterBluePlus.scanResults.listen(
    (results) {
        for (ScanResult r in results) {
            if (seen.contains(r.device.remoteId) == false) {
                print('${r.device.remoteId}: "${r.device.localName}" found! rssi: ${r.rssi}');
                seen.add(r.device.remoteId);
            }
        }
    },
    onError(e) => print(e);
);

// Start scanning
// Note: You should always call `scanResults.listen` before you call startScan!
await FlutterBluePlus.startScan();

// Stop scanning
await FlutterBluePlus.stopScan();
```

### Connect to a device

```dart
// listen for disconnection
device.connectionState.listen((BluetoothConnectionState state) async {
    if (state == BluetoothConnectionState.disconnected) {
        // 1. typically, start a periodic timer that tries to 
        //    periodically reconnect, or just call connect() again right now
        // 2. you must always re-discover services after disconnection!
        // 3. you should cancel subscriptions to all characteristics you listened to
    }
});

// Connect to the device
// Note: You should always call `connectionState.listen` before you call connect!
await device.connect();

// Disconnect from device
await device.disconnect();
```

### Discover services

```dart
// Note: You must call discoverServices after every connection!
List<BluetoothService> services = await device.discoverServices();
services.forEach((service) {
    // do something with service
});
```

### Read and write characteristics

```dart
// Reads all characteristics
var characteristics = service.characteristics;
for(BluetoothCharacteristic c in characteristics) {
    List<int> value = await c.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a characteristic
await c.write([0x12, 0x34]);
```

**allowLongWrite**: To write large characteristics (up to 512 bytes) regardless of mtu, use `allowLongWrite`:

```dart
/// allowLongWrite should be used with caution. 
///   1. it can only be used *with* response to avoid data loss
///   2. the peripheral device must support the 'long write' ble protocol.
///   3. Interrupted transfers can leave the characteristic in a partially written state
///   4. If the mtu is small, it is very very slow.
await c.write(data, allowLongWrite:true);
```

**splitWrite**: To write lots of data (unlimited), you can define the `splitWrite` function. 

```dart
import 'dart:math';
// writeSplit should be used with caution.
//    1. due to splitting, `characteristic.read()` will return partial data.
//    2. it can only be used *with* response to avoid data loss
//    3. The characteristic must support split data
extension splitWrite on BluetoothCharacteristic {
  Future<void> splitWrite(List<int> value, int mtu, {int timeout = 15}) async {
    int chunk = mtu-3;
    for (int i = 0; i < value.length; i += chunk) {
      List<int> subvalue = value.sublist(i, min(i + chunk, value.length));
      await write(subvalue, withoutResponse:false, timeout: timeout);
    }
  }
}
```

### Read and write descriptors

```dart
// Reads all descriptors
var descriptors = characteristic.descriptors;
for(BluetoothDescriptor d in descriptors) {
    List<int> value = await d.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a descriptor
await d.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

### Set notifications and listen to changes

If onValueReceived is never called, see [Common Problems](#common-problems) in the README.

```dart
// Setup Listener for characteristic reads
// If this is never called, see "Common Problems" in the README
final subscription = characteristic.onValueReceived.listen((value) {
    // do something with new value
});

// listen for disconnection
device.connectionState.listen((BluetoothConnectionState state) {
    if (state == BluetoothConnectionState.disconnected) {
        // stop listening to characteristic
        subscription.cancel();
    }
});

// enable notifications
await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
```

### Get Connected System Devices

These devices are already connected to the system, but must be reconnected by *your app* before you can communicate with them.

```dart
List<BluetoothDevice> connectedSystemDevices = await FlutterBluePlus.connectedSystemDevices;
for (var d in connectedSystemDevices) {
    await d.connect(); // Must connect *our* app to the device
    await d.discoverServices();
}
```

### Read the MTU and request larger size

```dart
final subscription = device.mtu.listen((int mtu) {
    // iOS: initial value is always 23, but iOS will quickly negotiate a higher value
    // android: you must request higher mtu yourself
    print("mtu $mtu");
});

// listen for disconnection
device.connectionState.listen((BluetoothConnectionState state) {
    if (state == BluetoothConnectionState.disconnected) {
        // stop listening to mtu stream
        subscription.cancel();
    }
});


// (Android Only)
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    await device.requestMtu(512);
}
```
### Create Bond (Android Only)

**Note:** calling this is usually not necessary!! The platform will do it automatically. 

However, you can force the popup to show sooner.

```dart
  /// Force the bonding popup to show now (Android Only) 
  await device.createBond();
```

## Getting Started

### Change the minSdkVersion for Android

flutter_blue_plus is compatible only from version 21 of Android SDK so you should change this in **android/app/build.gradle**:

```dart
Android {
  defaultConfig {
     minSdkVersion: 21
```

### Add permissions for Android (No Location)

In the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** add:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

### Add permissions for Android (With Fine Location)

If you want to use Bluetooth to determine location.

In the **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** add:

```xml
<!-- Tell Google Play Store that your app uses Bluetooth LE
     Set android:required="true" if bluetooth is necessary -->
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false" />

<!-- New Bluetooth permissions in Android 12
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

<!-- legacy for Android 11 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

<!-- legacy for Android 9 or lower -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

And set androidUsesFineLocation when scanning:
```dart
// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4), androidUsesFineLocation: true);
```

### Android Proguard

Add the following line in your `project/android/app/proguard-rules.pro` file:

```
-keep class com.boskokg.flutter_blue_plus.* { *; }
```

to avoid seeing the following kind errors in your `release` builds:

```
PlatformException(startScan, Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found. Known fields are
 [private int m0.e0.q, private b3.b0$i m0.e0.r, private boolean m0.e0.s, private static final m0.e0 m0.e0.t,
 private static volatile b3.a1 m0.e0.u], java.lang.RuntimeException: Field androidScanMode_ for m0.e0 not found
```

### Add permissions for iOS

In the **ios/Runner/Info.plist** let‚Äôs add:

```dart
	<dict>
	    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
	    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
```

For location permissions on iOS see more at: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/requesting_authorization_for_location_services)

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug issues in FlutterBluePlus is to make your own local copy.

```
cd /user/downloads
git clone https://github.com/boskokg/flutter_blue_plus.git
```

then in `pubspec.yaml` add the repo by path:

```
  flutter_blue_plus:
    path: /user/downloads/flutter_blue_plus
```

Now you can edit the FlutterBluePlus code yourself.

## Common Problems

Many common problems are easily solved.

---

### Scanning does not find my device

**1. your device uses bluetooth classic, not BLE.**

Headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, gamepads, & printers all use Bluetooth Classic. 

These devices may be found in System Settings, but they cannot be connected to by FlutterBluePlus. FlutterBluePlus only supports Bluetooth Low Energy.

**2. your device stopped advertising.**

- you might need to reboot your device
- you might need put your device in "discovery mode"
- your phone may have already connected automatically
- another app may have already connected to your device
- another phone may have already connected to your device

Try looking through already connected devices:

```dart
// search already connected devices, including devices
// connected to by other apps
List<BluetoothDevice> system = await FlutterBluePlus.connectedSystemDevices;
for (var d in system) {
    print('${r.device.localName} already connected to! ${r.device.remoteId}');
    if (d.localName == "myBleDevice") {
         await r.connect(); // must connect our app
    }
}
```

**3. your scan filters are wrong.**

- try removing all scan filters
- for `withServices` to work, your device must actively advertise the serviceUUIDs it supports


**4. try a ble scanner app**

Search the App Store for a BLE scanner apps and install it on your phone, and another phone.

**Question 1:** When the issue is happening, is *your phone* (the phone with your flutter app) able to scan it using the 3rd party scanner?

**Question 2:** When the issue is happening, is *another phone* able to scan it using the 3rd party scanner?

---

### Connection fails

**1. Your ble device may be low battery**

Bluetooth can become erratic when your peripheral device is low battery.

**2. Your ble device may have refused the connection or have a bug**

Connection is a two-way process. Your ble device may be misconfigured.

**3. You may be on the edge of the Bluetooth range.**

The signal is too weak, or there are a lot of devices causing radio interference.

**4. Some phones have an issue connecting while scanning.**

The Huawei P8 Lite is one of the reported phones to have this issue. Try stopping your scanner before connecting.

**5. Try restarting your phone**

Bluetooth is a complicated system service, and can enter a bad state.

---

### onValueReceived is never called

**1. you are not subscribed OR not calling read**

Your device will only send values after you call `await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true)`, or `await characteristic.read()`

**2. you are calling write instead of read**

`onValueReceived` is only called for reads & notifies, not writes.

You can do a single read with `await characteristic.read(...)`

**3. your device has nothing to send**

If you are using `setNotifyValue`, your device chooses when to send data.

Try interacting with your device to get it to send new data.

**4. your device has bugs**

Try rebooting your ble device. 

Some ble devices have buggy software and stop sending data

### onValueReceived is called with duplicate data

You are probably forgetting to cancel the original `stream.listen` resulting in multiple listens.

The easiest solution is to cancel all device subscriptions during disconnection.

```dart
final subscription = characteristic.onValueReceived.listen((value) {
    // ...
});

device.connectionState.listen((BluetoothConnectionState state) {
    if (state == BluetoothConnectionState.disconnected) {
        subscription.cancel(); // must cancel!
    }
});

await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
```

### characteristic writes fails

**1. the characeristic is not writeable**

Not all characeristics support `write`.
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `write`.

**2. the data length is too long**

Characteristics only support writes up to a certain size. 

`writeWithoutResponse`: you can only write up to (MTU-3) at a time. This is a BLE limitation.

`write (with response)`: look in the [Usage](#usage) section for functions you can use to solve this issue.

**3. the characeristic does not support writeWithoutResponse**

Not all characeristics support `writeWithoutResponse`. 
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `writeWithoutResponse`.

**4. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off mid-write, it will cause a failure.

**5. your bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**6. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.

### characteristic read fails

**1. the characeristic is not readable**

Not all characeristics support `read`.
 
Your device must have configured this characteristic to support `read`.

**2. your bluetooth device turned off, or is out of range**

If your device turns off mid-read, it will cause a failure.

**3. your bluetooth device has bugs**

Maybe your device crashed, or is not sending a response due to software bugs.

**4. there is radio interference**

Bluetooth is wireless and will not always work.
