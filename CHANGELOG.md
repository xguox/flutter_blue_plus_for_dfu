## Scanning API Changes

**Overview**:
* **[Refactor]** simplify scanning api
* **[Feature]** add `removeIfGone` option to `startScan`

**Breaking Changes & Improvements:**
- **(simplify)** removed `FlutterBluePlus.scan`. Use `FlutterBluePlus.scartScan(oneByOne: true)` instead.
- **(simplify)** removed `allowDuplicates` option for `scartScan`. It is not supported on android. We always filter duplicates anyway.
- **(simplify)** removed `macAddresses` option for `scartScan`. It was not supported on iOS, and is overall not very useful.
- **(simplify)** `startScan` now returns `Future<void>` instead of `Future<List<ScanResult>>`. It was redundant and confusing.
- **(improvement)** if you `await startScan` it will complete once the scan starts, instead of when it ends
- **(improvement)** if you call `startScan` twice, it will cancel the previous scan, instead of throwing an exception
